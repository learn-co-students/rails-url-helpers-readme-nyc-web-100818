Let's say you have built a Sinatra app that is a blogging platform. You have a Post and an Author model and you have controllers and routes for the CRUD actions of each model. You sit down at your computer and visit www.youramazingsinatrablog.com/posts:
What kind of web request is this making? (i.e. is it a GET, POST, etc request?)
What controller action (i.e. which route in which controller) will recieve that web request?
What is the response that your Sinatra app will send back to the client, i.e. the browser?
